JS DOM Events Lab
Background Random Color (Exercise)
My understanding of the assignment,my understanding of event handlers in coding and JavaScript are functions or methods that initate in response to particular events that occurs in the web browser, for example with this background random color we used the onclick feature and this element is triggered when clicked. My two buttons on pages does an action because it is triggered. Still having trouble add the color feature but I plan to do more research. 

 Click (Exercise)
 My understanding for the of browser events are the that they are the basic functionality of how the DOM works in JavaScript. DOM is short for Document Object Model and it gives the website actions and functions to sort out and show for the browser. The changes that was made in JavaScript and the Index allows the page to have actions attached to the the different actions perfomed on the computer by an onlooker.
