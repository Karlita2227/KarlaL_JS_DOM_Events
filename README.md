JS DOM Events Lab
Background Random Color (Exercise)
 of the assignment,my understanding of event handlers in coding and JavaScript are functions or methods that initate in response to particular events that occurs in the web browser, for example with this background random color we used the onclick feature and this element is triggered when clicked. My two buttons on pages does an action because it is triggered. Still having trouble add the color feature but I plan to do more research.
